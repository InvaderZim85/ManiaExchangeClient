## General
This is a small program to gather informations from [Mania Exchange](https://tm.mania-exchange.com/) via their provides [API](https://api.mania-exchange.com/).

## Using
![Main window](Images/001.png)

The usage of the program is very straight forward. You can search for tracks by using the following options:
- Track name
- Author
- Environment

Or you use one of the predefined filters:
- Latest tracks
- Recently awarded
- Best of the week
- Best of the month
- Competitive tracks of the week
- Competitive tracks of the month

> *Note*: If you use one of the predefined filters. Only 10 entries will be loaded and it seems that the filters not working as the filters on the website. So it can be that the results are different from the results of the website.

> *Note*: The search process needs some seconds. I've added a timeout to prevent endless searching.
